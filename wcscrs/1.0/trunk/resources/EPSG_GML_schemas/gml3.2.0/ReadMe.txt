This archive contains ISO/DIS 19136 = GML 3.2.0 as sent to ISO Central Secretariat (file ISO_DIS_19136_(E)_.pdf). A few editorial changes are required before publishing the document as an OGC document:

- replace by version that eventually will be published by ISO Central Secretariat as ISO/DIS 19136 (expected in 1-3 weeks)
- change ISO Copyright to OGC Copyright 
- replace ISO cover page with OGC cover page 
- change name from ISO/DIS 19136 to GML 3.2.0
- change foreword to planned joint forword for common ISO/OGC documents if that becomes available in-time or change forward to indicate that it is an OGC document

Once ISO/DIS 19136 has been published by ISO Central Secretariat, there will be a five month voting period.
