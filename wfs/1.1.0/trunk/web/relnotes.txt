1	The MIME returned for a DescribeFeatureType request where no specific output format is requested is "text/xml; subtype=gml/3.1.1"
2	When output format XMLSCHEMA is supported, the MIME returned for a DescribeFeatureType request where the output format requested is XMLSCHEMA is "text/xml; subtype=gml/2.1.2"
3	When output format "text/xml; subtype=gml/2.1.2" is supported, the MIME returned for a DescribeFeatureType request where the output format requested is "text/xml; subtype=gml/2.1.2" is "text/xml; subtype=gml/2.1.2"
4	The MIME returned for a DescribeFeatureType request where the output format requested is "text/xml; subtype=gml/3.1.1" is "text/xml; subtype=gml/3.1.1"
5	The MIME returned for a GetFeature request where no specific output format is requested is "text/xml; subtype=gml/3.1.1"
6	When output format GML2 is supported, the MIME returned for a GetFeature request where the output format requested is XMLSCHEMA is "text/xml; subtype=gml/2.1.2"
7	Whe output format "text/xml; subtype=gml/2.1.2" is supported, the MIME returned for a GetFeature request where the output format requested is "text/xml; subtype=gml/2.1.2" is "text/xml; subtype=gml/2.1.2"
8	N/A - NSG specific
9	The response for a DescribeFeatureType request with an invalid feature type is an exception.
10	N/A - NSG specific
11	A GetGmlObject request with traverseXlinkDepth = * is resolved correctly.
12	When a GetFeature request with XLink elements is not resolved in less time than the traverseXlinkExpiry, an exception is returned.
13	After a LockFeature request with an expiry attribute is submitted and the time expires, the lock is released
14	In response to a LockFeature request that includes some locked and some unlocked feature identifiers and lockAction=SOME, the response is a <WFS_LockFeatureResponse> element that lists the previously unlocked feature ids in the <FeaturesLocked> element and the previously locked feature ids in the <FeaturesNotLocked> element.  The previously unlocked features are locked.
15	The response to a LockFeature request includes the identifiers of features that were locked.
16	In response to a LockFeature request that contains a filter that doesn't match any features, the response is a <WFS_LockFeatureResponse> document that contains a value for the lockId attribute but contains neither a <FeaturesLocked> element nor a <FeatureNotLocked> element.
17	N/A - NSG specific
18	An invalid LockFeature request results in an exception
19	A transaction request with an invalid lock identifier returns an exception
20	In response to an Insert Transaction request with idgen=GenerateNew, the service generates unique identifiers for the newly inserted feature instances
21	In response to an Insert Transaction request with idgen=UseExisting where the identifiers are new values that do not belong to any existing features in the WFS, the service uses the existing gml:id identifiers for the newly inserted feature instances
22	In response to an Insert Transaction request with idgen=UseExisting where one of the identifiers used belongs to any existing features in the WFS, the service returns an exception
23	A valid HTTP Get request with an extra parameter not recognized by the WFS does not return an exception
25	Execute WFS transaction with XlinkPropertyName and test for exception.
24	N/A
26	Default resultType for GetFeature is results. Execute GetFeature with the resultType=results explicitly

2009-09-30 (efreese):
- Changes to wfs-1.1.0-Basic-GetFeature-tc102.1:
	The sorting test was failing because the 2nd occurrence of sf:EntitéGénérique 
	was not a valid XPath.  Modified the XPath to find the 2nd occurrence of 
	gml:featureMember in order to have 2 values to compare. (Issue 347)


=== Changes included in R1 ===

2009-07-09 (kstegemoller):
- tag r1 - WFS 1.1.0 with XLink

2009-06-10 (aschmitz):
- Changes to resources/xsd/ogc/cite/cite-gmlsf1.xsd:
        Re-added the missing sf:reference property. Some tests 
        eg. wfs-1.1.0-Transaction-tc21.1 rely on having this property.
- Changes to resources/xsd/ogc/cite/cite-gmlsf0.xsd:
        Changed the type of relatedFeature to
        <xsd:complexType>
          <xsd:sequence minOccurs="0">
            <xsd:element ref="gml:_Feature" />
          </xsd:sequence>
          <xsd:attributeGroup ref="gml:AssociationAttributeGroup"/>
        </xsd:complexType>
        to enable validation similar to the sf:reference property in
        sf:LinkedFeature.
- Changes in wfs-1.1.0-Basic-GetFeature-tc37.1:
        The last test failed, because a relatedFeature had to be fetched which
        did not have the requested property. I changed the XPath of the test
        to check only the root level feature.
- Changes in wfs-1.1.0-Basic-GetFeature-tc39.1:
        The problem is the same as for 37.1, fixed in the same way by changing
        the last xpath to check the root level feature only.
        Comment:The PrimitiveGeoFeature is actually a complex one in the
        latest wfs  1.1.0 testdata, leading to the above described problems.
        The xlink tests rely on having the references/sub features present.
- Changes in GetGmlObject POST-2:
        Changed xpath from
        substring-after($sources/sf:LinkedFeature[1]/sf:reference/@xlink:href,'#')
        to $sources/sf:LinkedFeature[1]/sf:reference/*[1]/@gml:id
        to actually extract the ID.
- Changes in GetGmlObject POST-5/6:
        The initial GetFeature did not include a traverseXlinkDepth attribute,
        yet assumed that no properties had been resolved. Our service uses
        traverseXlinkDepth="*" by default. So I changed the request to use
        traverseXlinkDepth="0" explicitly, since it seems not to be specified
        what's the default value.
- Changes in GetFeature POST-2:
        Same as POST-5/6 for GetGmlObject.
- Changes in GetFeature POST-3:
        The GetFeature includes traverseXlinkDepth="1", yet it tests whether the
        locator attribute has not been removed. I changed the test to check for
        removal of the locator attribute instead (as stated in the explanatory text).
- Changes in GetFeature POST-9:
        Namespace binding for gml prefix was missing in the request.
- Changes in GetFeature POST-10:
        Added traverseXlinkDepth="0" on the request, because our service uses *
        if not specified but the test assumes 0. Also added a gml:name
        PropertyName, as some of the tests use its value and it's optional (and
        thus is not supposed to be included when it's not enlisted in the
        (Xlink)PropertyName list.
- Changes in GetFeature POST-11:
        Included gml:name to the property list (see POST-10).

2009-02-10 (cmorris):
- Update test wfs-1.1.0-Basic-GetCapabilities-tc11.1 to allow the content-type
  header to be text/xml in addition to application/xml.  OWS Common clearly
  states that text/xml should be used if the AcceptFormats parameter is omitted
  or not supported.

2008-08-20 (aschmitz):
- Fixed test 405.10 to test each feature for at least one matching timestamp value.

2008-08-15 (aschmitz):
- Fixed two tests (405.2 and 405.6) where only the first occurrence of a property
  was tested for equality, while the matching property could also be one later in
  the list (maxOccurs="unbounded").
- Fixed typo (PrimitiveGeoFeature -> ComplexGeoFeature), also allowed for both
  featureMembers and featureMember.
- Fixed typo when comparing resulting sf:typeCode (AQ604 -> AQ064).
- Fixed extraction of feature id (strip leading '#').

2007-08 - 2008-02 (OWS5):
- Added XLink support
- Modified test data
- Other misc. changes
