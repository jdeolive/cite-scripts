Changes included in latest revision:

2009-10-12 (kstegemoller):
 - tag r0 
 - no new changes

2009-10-7 (cmorris):
- Corrected time parameter on test getcoverage_operations-getcoverage_request-time-get-kvp-1 (Issue 307)
- Added CRS parameter to test getcoverage_operations-getcoverage_request-time-get-kvp-2 (Issues 330, 309)
- Added tests and bug fixes written for NSG that apply to the base WCS specification:
1	Each HTTP GET URL prefix ends in either a '?' or a '&'
2	The server handles encoded commas and spaces in list values correctly if any coverage names contain commas or spaces
3	Service exception XML validates according to the Service Exception XML Schema
4	N/A - NSG specific
5	The version and updateSequence attributes are omitted from all of the three capabilities sections (Service, Capability, and ContentMetadata) element when the full Capabilities XML is retrieved.
6	When a GetCoverage request is made with a BBOX inside the defined Bounding BOX, the server returns content.
7	When a GetCoverage request is made with a BBOX partly contained in the defined Bounding BOX, the server returns content.
8	For coverages with a temporal domain with time instants, a GetCoverage request with a temporalSubset that specifies a time instant returns content.
9	For coverages with a temporal domain with time periods, a GetCoverage request with a temporalSubset that specifies a time period returns content.
10	For coverages with at least one RectifiedGrid, each of the supportedCRSs is the same as the srsName of one of its RectifiedGrids
11	If the describeCoverage provides a NativeCRSs element, a getcoverage request with this request succeeds without distortion or degradation of the coverage data.
12	N/A - NSG specific
13	SupportedInterpolations is absent, empty, or has a default attribute that specifies one of the child interpolation methods.
14	For each of the advertised interpolation methods, the server returns content.
15	When a request contains a BBOX in upper,lower instead of lower,upper format, the service returns an exception.
16	If the only interpolation method supported is "none", a GetCoverage request that uses resolution parameters to request a coverage that is not at the native resolution returns an exception.
17	If the only interpolation method supported is "none", a GetCoverage request that uses height and width parameters to request a coverage that is not at the native resolution returns an exception.
18	A coverage request using RESX, RESY, RESZ and INTERPOLATION=none raises an exception.
19	A coverage request using RESESPONSE_CRS and INTERPOLATION=none raises an exception.
20	A coverage request that specifies aGML Rectified grid in its domain subset returns a valid coverage.
21	A valid getCoverage response is returned for each supportedFormat
22	If they exist, UPDATESEQUENCE values work with GetCapabilities requests. Test UPDATESEQUENCE parameters with GetCapabilities requests (same as WCS 1.1.1 tests)
23	To return a coverage in multiple part files, the multi-part MIME encoding is used by the service.
24	N/A - NSG specific
25	Each coverage offering supports at least one of these: GeoTIFF, HDF-EOS, DTED, NITF, or GML
